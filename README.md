# WeaklyTransferNILM

This repository refers to the work presented at AII 2022 "Weakly Supervised Transfer Learning for
Multi-label Appliance Classification". The code allows to create a balanced version of the dataset and train/test the different weakly 
transfer learning strategies based on weak supervision. 
Both pre-trained and fine-tuned models are available.
